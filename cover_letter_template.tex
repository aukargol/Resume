I am very excited about your position open for Software Engineers with a specialization in Computer Vision and Robotics. With this letter I would like to explain a little about my qualifications for this position.
\vspace{1em}

I enjoy working on high-impact projects that have a chance to significantly improve people's lives. I am familiar with a variety of languages, frameworks, and libraries, including Python, C++/C, Matlab, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, AWS, Django, Qt, ROS, OpenCV, PCL, and libSVM.  I have experience working with very large real-world systems where efficiency and reliability are essential.

I am a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis, where I work with Dr. Robert Pless. As a member of Dr. Pless's lab, I work with the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS), the world's largest publicly available archive of outdoor webcam imagery, which currently has over 600 million images. I build tools, both crowdsourced and automated, to use AMOS imagery to gather data on the effectiveness of public health initiatives. I work on improving the accuracy of automated pedestrian detection algorithms through better feature selection, background subtraction, and shadow detection.  I am the primary developer for Amazon Mechanical Turk tasks that utilize AMOS images. I also work as part of a team working the Django backend of AMOS, developing new features and expanding the API. 

\vspace{1em}

I also worked with Dr. Bill Smart, working with the PR2 robot, designing a point-and-click robot control interface for picking up objects. The overarching goal of the project was to create a software suite to allow a PR2 to function as a surrogate for a paraplegic user. 



\vspace{1em}

At  \company, I would bring my passion for improving lives, my diverse background, and my expertise in both Computer Vision and Robotics. I hope that you will consider me for the position, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
